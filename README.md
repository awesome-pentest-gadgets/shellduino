# shellduino
#### Malduino automated to create a reverse shell.
The code in shellduino.ino can be 
usedso that a Pro Micro can act as a silent Human Interface Device to download netcat through powershell and cmd and thereafter executing it.

***Note:***
The default host is **192.168.1.1** and default port is **33455**.
However they can later be changed while uploading according to the users choice.
